# Ownbrew

My alternative to Homebrew, just a few bash script to install the essentials.

## Setup

I would recommend placing Ownbrew in a hidden folder in your home directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:haukurh/ownbrew.git ~/.ownbrew
```

In utils.sh you can define the location where to install.

## Installing

Inside you will find folder for each program that's available, along with a setup script for said program.

You just need to run install script for the desired program, some might have dependencies.

## Platform

These scripts are written for macOS Big Sur.

## Why?

Because why not?
